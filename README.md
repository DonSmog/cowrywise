About the Project

This project was done in February 2025 as a requirement for the Frontend Role at Cowrywise.
For this project, Vite + React + Tailwind was used as well as tanstack query for data fetching and caching.

The objective of the project was to create a mini-clone of unsplash with default search set to "African". On search for anything, the loading state should appear first and then the result in a grid like display. On click of each image, a modal displaying the image, name and location should pop up.
